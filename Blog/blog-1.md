🛠️ Mastering TypeScript: Union vs. Intersection Types 🚀

Understanding Union (|) and Intersection (&) types in TypeScript can take your coding to the next level!

Union Types (|):

Union types allow a variable to be of multiple types, giving you more flexibility.

Example: type UserInput = string | number;

Use Case: When a function can accept different data types (like a form input that handles both text and numbers).

Intersection Types (&):

Intersection types combine multiple types into one, ensuring the variable satisfies all the combined types.
Example:

Type Person = { name: string } & { age: number };

Use Case: When you need an object to meet requirements from multiple interfaces.

Why Use Them?
Enhanced type safety
More flexible and robust code
Better code readability
